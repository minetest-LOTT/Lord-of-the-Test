	"poorest of the dwarves of Middle Earth, with a large part of them " ..
	"being made of exiles from the various calamities which befell the " ..
	"dwarves over their history, such as the sinking of Beleiand and the " ..
	"waking of the Balrog. While they are the poorest, they are not " ..
	"poor, and still prosper in their own way, mining and creating " ..

	"despite the many dangers found there, not just from the cold and " ..
	"weather, but also from the orcs and other creatures who inhabit the " ..

	"outside its bounds, most of whom can be found in Bree and the " ..
	"surrounding area. These hobbits have maintained much more contact " ..
	"with the outside world than their kin in the Shire, due in part to " ..

	man_rhun = "The Men of Rhun have been unable to escape from the " ..
	"influence of evil from their earliest days. First they were corrupted " ..

	"passes and troubling the folk of Eriador. These Orcs were also responsible for the " ..
	"death of Isildur and the loss of the One Ring. Later on, far from Sauron's main " ..
